# NearbyNet: Proximity-based Professional Networking 

Students on college campuses need a real-time networking platform that allows them to socialize with like-minded students, whenever and wherever they are. Despite the many scheduled networking opportunities, students deserve a real-time opportunity to network in a way that makes sense to them. '

Our cloud-based platform notifies students if they are within a specific radius of a peer that has common interests, giving students the opportunity to connect with colleagues on campus, in smaller, more convenient intervals.
